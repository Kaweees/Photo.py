# About EXIF
EXIF is short for Exchangeable Image File Format. It is a very common image standard used for storing image metadata. It has been adopted by nearly all digital cameras and other types of image files. By extracting the metadata, you can find information such as the date and time the image was taken, the camera model used to take the photo, and other interesting information.
